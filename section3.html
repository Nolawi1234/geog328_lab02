          <h1>Discussion & Perspectives</h1>

    <h2>Two Perspectives on the Pay Gap</h2>
    <p>
      In this project I looked at the difference between salaries and wages in the NBA vs WNBA.
      There are two main perspectives:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>It’s unfair:</strong> This view says women are not paid as much as men even though they
        are elite professional athletes doing the same job. From this angle, the gap is an equity issue.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>It follows revenue:</strong> This view argues the WNBA brings in less money than the NBA
        (fewer viewers, smaller media deals, smaller arenas), so salaries end up being lower.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Might Drive the Gap?</h2>
    <p>
      Based on my reading and simple comparisons, the pay gap likely ties to multiple factors working together:
      league age and history, audience size and media attention, sponsorships and merchandise sales, arena
      capacities, and how each league’s CBA/structure distributes revenue. My question was whether it’s
      “just views,” and the answer seems to be that viewership is important, but it’s also connected to those
      other pieces.
    </p>

    <h2>My Takeaway</h2>
    <p>
      The NBA has been around much longer, while the WNBA launched in the late 1990s. That head start has built
      bigger audiences and bigger deals for the NBA. The WNBA’s growth in interest suggests the gap can change
      over time as the league continues to expand its fan base and partnerships. I wanted to see if the gap was
      only about views; I learned it’s views <em>plus</em> revenue systems that have developed over many years.
