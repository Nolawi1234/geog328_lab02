        <h1>Historical Background & Viewership</h1>

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
      The NBA was first established in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).
      In 1949, it merged with the NBL to become the modern NBA. Fifty years later, in 1996,
      the WNBA was founded; its inaugural season began in 1997 with eight teams. The WNBA was
      the first women’s professional basketball league in the U.S. to launch with full backing
      from an established men’s league.
    </p>

     <h2>Viewership</h2>
    <p>
      On average, the NBA draws about <strong>1.6 million</strong> viewers per regular-season game,
      while the WNBA averages around <strong>505,000</strong>. Playoffs and Finals amplify the gap:
      recent NBA Finals have drawn roughly <strong>17.11 million</strong> viewers, compared to
      approximately <strong>1.12 million</strong> for the WNBA Finals. Many argue this audience
      difference heavily influences league revenues and, downstream, salaries.
